# Proxies
#     Codenvy's internal system services such as HAProxy and its internal JVMs need to
#     have system level properties applied so that they can reach the Internet. Codenvy's
#     system uses the Internet to communicate with DockerHub for downloading images that
#     are used to run Codenvy's systems. Note that you must configure proxy access in three
#     locations. First, you enabled your system Docker daemon to use proxies. Second, you
#     configure proxies for Codenvy's internal system services. Third, if you want your users
#     to access the Internet, then you should also add proxy values for their workspaces.
#
#     Please be mindful of the proxy URL formatting. Proxies are unforgiving if you do not type
#     the URL just right, inclduing the protocol and whether they allow a trailing /.

#         Period declares that 100% is equal to 5000 units

#     CGroups allow admins to to configure limits on nodes in a system in a specific

#     without a slash for relative value. Docker will create this cgroup if it is missing.
#     Admin can configure limits on this cgroup on all nodes in a system specific way.
#     Example:
#         On Ubuntu 16.04 use CODENVY_DOCKER_PARENT_CGROUP=/my_group. Then let container
#         create cgoup by running Codenvy. Then edit
#         /sys/fs/cgroup/<resource folder>/my_group/<resource file>
#         For example to limit CPU cores to 0-1 put value "0-1" into file

# Workspace Snapshots
#     By default, when a workspace is stopped, we snapshot its state, create a Docker image 
#     of it, and then save that image in a private Docker registry that is started when
#     Codenvy starts. Codenvy's built-in registry  is not secure and only works 
#     if your Docker daemon is configured to work with insecure registries, which it typically
#     is. More info: https://docs.docker.com/registry/insecure/
#
#     You can replace Codenvy's internal insecure registry with your own, such as JFrog
#     Artifactor or Docker Enterprise Registry.

WORKSPACE_AUTO__RESTORE: CODENVY_WORKSPACE_AUTO_RESTORE

# Private Images
#      If your stacks need to pull images that are private, which require authenticated
#      access by the Docker client. Or, if you have Codenvy configured to save workspace
#      snapshots to a private registry that requires authentication before an image can
#      be pushed, then you need to add that registry's authentication credentials.
#
#      Once these registries are configured, you can create stacks that use recipes
#      with Dockerfiles that reference private images using the
#      'FROM <your-registry>/<your-repo> syntax.
#
#      We have separate configurations for AWS EC2 vs. a Docker registry. You can add
#      as many registries for authentication as necessary by appending REGISTRY[n] ID to
#      each entry.

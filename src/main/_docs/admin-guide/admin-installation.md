# Get Help
If you are a Codenvy customer, you can open an email ticket for 24/7/365 support.

We want everyone to have a great experience installing and running Codenvy. If you run into an issue, please [open a GitHub issue](http://github.com/codenvy/codenvy/issues) providing:

- Output of 'docker run codenvy/cli info' command
- If requested, a support package with 'docker run codenvy/cli info --bundle'

# Quick Start
With Docker 1.11+ (1.12.5+ recommended) on Windows, Mac, or Linux:

```
$ docker run codenvy/cli start
```

This gives you additional instructions on how to run the Codenvy CLI while setting your hostname, configuring volume mounts, and testing your Docker setup. For full install syntax [see below]({{base}}{{site.links["admin-installation"]}}#installation).

# Licensing
Codenvy starts with a Fair Source 3 license, which allows up to three users in an organization to use Codenvy with full functionality and limited liabilities and warranties. You can request a trial license from Codenvy for more than 3 users or purchase one from our friendly sales team (sales@codenvy.com). Once you gain the license, start Codenvy and then apply the license in the admin dashboard that is accessible with your login credentials.

Licenses require the host to be connected to the internet. If you require a license for a system that isn't connected to the internet please contact sales@codenvy.com.

# Installation
We abbreviate `codenvy [COMMAND]`, for the full `docker run ...` syntax for readability.

## Sample Start
An example to install and start Codenvy data saved on a Windows file system at C:\tmp

`docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /c/tmp:/data codenvy/cli start`

This installs a Codenvy configuration, downloads Codenvy's Docker images, run pre-flight port checks, boot Codenvy's services, and run post-flight checks. You do not need root access to start Codenvy, unless your environment requires it for Docker operations.

A successful start will display:

### Logs and User Data
When Codenvy initializes itself, it stores logs, user data, database data, and instance-specific configuration in the folder mounted to `:/data/instance` or an `instance` subfolder of what you mounted to `:/data`.  

Codenvy's containers save their logs in the same location:

```
/instance/logs/codenvy/<year>               # Server logs
/instance/logs/codenvy/che-machine-logs     # Workspace logs
/instance/logs/nginx                        # nginx access and error logs
/instance/logs/haproxy                      # HAproxy logs
```

User data is stored in:

```
/instance/data/codenvy                      # Project backups (we synchronize projs from remote ws here)
/instance/data/postgres                     # Postgres data folder (users, workspaces, stacks etc)
/instance/data/registry                     # Workspace snapshots
```

Instance configuration is generated by Codenvy and is updated by our internal configuration utilities. These 'generated' configuration files should not be modified:

```
/instance/codenvy.ver.do_not_modify         # Version of Codenvy installed
/instance/docker-compose-container.yml      # Docker compose to launch internal services
/instance/docker-compose.yml                # Docker compose to launch Codenvy from the host without contianer
/instance/config                            # Configuration files which are input mounted into the containers
```

### Versions
Each version of Codenvy is available as a Docker image tagged with a label that matches the version, such as `codenvy/cli:5.0.0-M7`. You can see all versions available by running `docker run codenvy/cli version` or by [browsing DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/codenvy/cli/tags/).

We maintain "redirection" labels which reference special versions of Codenvy:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `latest` | The most recent stable release of Codenvy. |
| `5.0.0-latest` | The most recent stable release of Codenvy on the 5.x branch. |
| `nightly` | The nightly build of Codenvy. |

The software referenced by these labels can change over time. Since Docker will cache images locally, the `codenvy/cli:<version>` image that you are running locally may not be current with the one cached on DockerHub. Additionally, the `codenvy/cli:<version>` image that you are running references a manifest of Docker images that Codenvy depends upon, which can also change if you are using these special redirection tags.

In the case of 'latest' images, when you initialize an installation using the CLI, we encode your `/instance/codenvy.ver` file with the numbered version that latest references. If you begin using a CLI version that mismatches what was installed, you will be presented with an error.

To avoid issues that can appear from using 'nightly' or 'latest' redirectoins, you may:

1. Verify that you have the most recent version with `docker pull eclipse/cli:<version>`.
2. When running the CLI, commands that use other Docker images have an optional `--pull` and `--force` command line option [which will instruct the CLI to check DockerHub]({{base}}/docs/admin-guide/configuration/index.html) for a newer version and pull it down. Using these flags will slow down performance, but ensures that your local cache is current.

If you are running Codenvy using a tagged version that is a not a redirection label, such as `5.0.0-M7`, then these caching issues will not happen.

## Volume Mounts
We use volume mounts to configure certain parts of Codenvy. The presence or absence of certain volume mounts will trigger certain behaviors in the system. For example, you can volume mount a Codenvy source git repository with `:/repo` to active development mode where we start Codenvy's containers using source code from the repository instead of the software inside of the default containers.

At a minimum, you must volume mount a local path to `:/data`, which will be the location that Codenvy installs its configuration, user data, version and log information. Codenvy also leaves behind a `cli.log` file in this location to debug any odd behaviors while running the system. In this folder we also create a `codenvy.env` file which contains all of the admin configuration that you can set or override in a single location.

You can also use volume mounts to override the location of where your user or backup data is stored. By default, these folders will be created as sub-folders of the location that you mount to `:/data`. However, if you do not want your `/instance`, and `/backup` folder to be children, you can set them individually with separate overrides.

```
docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
                    -v <local-path>:/data
                    -v <a-different-path>:/data/instance
                    -v <another-path>:/data/backup
                       codenvy/cli:<version> [COMMAND]    

```

## Hostnames
Codenvy must be accessed over DNS hostnames. We will attempt to auto-set the hostname (`CODENVY_HOST`) by running an internal utility `docker run --net=host eclipse/che-ip:nightly`. This approach is not fool-proof. This utility is usually accurate on desktops, but often fails on hosted servers. If it fails you can explicitly set this value when executing the docker run:

```
docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
                    -v <local-path>:/data
                    -e CODENVY_HOST=<your-ip-or-host>
                       codenvy/cli:<version> [COMMAND]
```

Alternatively, you can edit the `CODENVY_HOST` value in `codenvy.env`. 

## Proxy Installation
Codenvy can be installed and operated from behind a proxy:

1. Configure each physical node's Docker daemon with proxy access.
2. Optionally, override the default workspace proxy settings for users if you want to restrict their Internet access.

Before starting Codenvy, configure [Docker's daemon for proxy access](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/systemd/#/http-proxy). If you plan to scale Codenvy with multiple host nodes, each host node must have its Docker daemon configured for proxy access. If you have Docker for Windows or Docker for Mac installed on your desktop and installing Codenvy, these utilities have a GUI in their settings which let you set the proxy settings directly.

`HTTP_PROXY` and/or `HTTPS_PROXY` set in the Docker daemon must have a protocol and port number. Proxy configuration is quite finnicky, so please ensure you have provided a fully qualified proxy location.

If you configure `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` in your Docker daemon, Codenvy automatically adds `localhost,127.0.0.1,codenvy-swarm,CODENVY_HOST` to your `NO_PROXY` value where `CODENVY_HOST` is the DNS or IP address. We recommend that you check these values in your `codenvy.env` and add the short and long form DNS entry to your Docker's `NO_PROXY` setting if it is not already set.

This is the full set of proxy-related values in the `codenvy.env`. You can optionally modify these with different values:

```
CODENVY_HTTP_PROXY_FOR_CODENVY=<YOUR_PROXY_FROM_DOCKER>
CODENVY_HTTPS_PROXY_FOR_CODENVY=<YOUR_PROXY_FROM_DOCKER>
CODENVY_NO_PROXY_FOR_CODENVY=localhost,127.0.0.1,codenvy-swarm,<YOUR_CODENVY_HOST>

CODENVY_HTTP_PROXY_FOR_CODENVY_WORKSPACES=<YOUR_PROXY_FROM_DOCKER>
CODENVY_HTTPS_PROXY_FOR_CODENVY_WORKSPACES=<YOUR_PROXY_FROM_DOCKER>
CODENVY_NO_PROXY_FOR_CODENVY_WORKSPACES=localhost,127.0.0.1,<YOUR_CODENVY_HOST>
```

The last three entries are injected into workspaces created by your users. This gives your users access to the Internet from within their workspaces. You can comment out these entries to disable access. However, if that access is turned off, then the default templates with source code will fail to be created in workspaces as those projects are cloned from GitHub.com. Your workspaces are still functional, we just prevent the template cloning.

## Firewall Tests
Firewalls will typically cause traffic problems to appear when you are starting a new workspace or adding a new physical node for scaling. There are certain network configurations where we direct networking traffice between workspaces and Codenvy through external IP addresses, which can flow through routers or firewalls. If ports or protocols are blocked, then certain Codenvy functions will be unavailable.

#### Running Codenvy Behind a Firewall (Linux/Mac)

```shell
# Check to see if firewall is running:
systemctl status firewalld

# Check for list of open ports
# Verify that ports 80tcp, 443tcp, 2376tcp, 4789udp, 7946tcp/udp, 23750tcp, 32768-65535tcp are open
firewall-cmd --list-ports

# Optionally open ports on your local firewall:
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp
... and so on

# You can also verify that ports are open:
nmap -Pn -p <port> localhost

# If the port is closed, then you need to open it by editing /etc/pf.conf.
# For example, open port 1234 for TCP for all interfaces:
pass in proto tcp from any to any port 1234

# And then restart your firewall
```

If you are going to be scaling Codenvy with additional workspace nodes, then each workspace node also needs to have ports `2375 tcp`, `2376 tcp`, `4789 udp`, `7946 tcp/udp`, and `32768-65535 tcp` are open on each node.

If you are going to use the embedded Zabbix monitor that is deployed with Codenvy, then you must also have port `10050 tcp` open on the master node and the workspace nodes.

#### Running Codenvy Behind a Firewall (Windows)

There are many third party firewall services. Different versions of Windows OS also have different firewall configurations. The built-in Windows firewall can be configured in the control panel under "System and Security":

1. In the left pane, right-click `Inbound Rules`, and then click `New Rule` in the action pane.
2. In the `Rule Type` dialog box, select `Port`, and then click `Next`.
3. In the `Protocol and Ports` dialog box, select `TCP`. 
4. Select speicfic local ports, enter the port number to be opened and click `Next`.
5. In the `Action` dialog box, select `Allow the Connection`, and then click `Next`.
6. In the `Name` dialog box, type a name and description for this rule, and then click `Finish`.

## Offline Installation
We support offline (disconnected from the Internet) installation and operation. This is helpful for  restricted environments, regulated datacenters, or offshore installations. The offline installation downloads the CLI, core system images, and any stack images while you are within a network DMZ with DockerHub access. You can then move those files to a secure environment and start Codenvy.

### 1. Save Codenvy Images
While connected to the Internet, download Codenvy's Docker images:

```
codenvy offline
```

The CLI will download images and save them to `/backup/*.tar` with each image saved as its own file. You can save these files to a differnet location by volume mounting a local folder to `:/data/backup`. The version tag of the CLI Docker image will be used to determine which versions of dependent images to download. There is about 1GB of data that will be saved.

The default execution will download none of the optional stack images, which are needed to launch workspaces of a particular type. There are a few dozen stacks for different programming languages and some of them are over 1GB in size. It is unlikely that your users will need all of the stacks, so you do not need to download all of them. You can get a list of available stack images by running `codenvy offline --list`. You can download a specific stack by running `codenvy offline --image:<image-name>` and the `--image` flag can be repeatedly used on a single command line.

### 2. Start Codenvy In Offline Mode
Place the TAR files into a folder in the offline computer. If the files are in placed in a folder named `/tmp/offline`, you can run Codenvy in offline mode with: 

```
# Load the CLI
docker load < /tmp/offline/codenvy_cli:<version>.tar

# Start Codenvy in offline mode
docker run <other-properties> -v /tmp/offline:/data/backup codenvy/cli:<version> start --offline
```

The `--offline` parameter instructs Codenvy CLI to load all of the TAR files located in the folder mounted to `/data/backup`. These images will then be used instead of routing out to the Internet to check for DockerHub. The preboot sequence takes place before any CLI functions make use of Docker. The `codenvy start`, `codenvy download`, and `codenvy init` commands support `--offline` mode which triggers this preboot seequence.

# Uninstall

```
# Remove your Codevy configuration and destroy user projects and database
docker run codenvy/cli:<version> destroy [--quiet|--cli]

# Delete Codenvy's images from your Docker registry
docker run codenvy/cli:<version> rmi

# Delete the Codenvy CLI
docker rmi -f codenvy/cli
```
 
# System Requirements
Codenvy installs on Linux, Mac and Windows.

## Hardware
The Codenvy server requires a minimum of:

* 2 cores
* 4GB RAM
* 3GB disk space

Codenvy services require 2 GB storage and 4 GB RAM. The RAM, CPU and storage resources required for your users' workspaces are additive. Codenvy's Docker images consume ~900MB of disk and the Docker images for your workspace templates can each range from 5MB up to 1.5GB. Codenvy and its dependent core containers will consume about 500MB of RAM, and your running workspaces will each require at least 250MB RAM, depending upon user requirements and complexity of the workspace code and intellisense. Java workspaces, for example, typically require ~750MB for workspace agents.

Boot2Docker, docker-machine, Docker for Windows, and Docker for Mac are all Docker variations that launch VMs with Docker running in the VM with access to Docker from your host. We recommend increasing your default VM size to at least 4GB. Each of these technologies have different ways to allow host folder mounting into the VM. Please enable this for your OS so that Codenvy data is persisted on your host disk.

## Software

* Docker 1.11+ (1.12.5+ recommended)

The Codenvy CLI - a Docker image - manages the other Docker images and supporting utilities that Codenvy uses during its configuration or operations phases. The CLI also provides utilities for downloading an offline bundle to run Codenvy while disconnected from the network.

Given the nature of the development and release cycle it is important that you have the latest version of docker installed because any issue that you encounter might have already been fixed with a newer Docker release.

Install the most recent version of the Docker Engine for your platform using the [official Docker releases](http://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), including support for Mac and Windows!  If you are on Linux, you can also install with `wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh`.

Sometimes Fedora and RHEL/CentOS users will encounter issues with SElinux. Try disabling selinux with `setenforce 0` and check if resolves the issue. If using the latest docker version and/or disabling selinux does not fix the issue then please file a issue request on the [issues](https://github.com/codenvy/codenvy/issues) page. If you are a licensed customer of Codenvy, you can get prioritized support with support@codenvy.com.

## Ports and Architecture
Codenvy's runtime launches a group of Docker containers in a compose relationship. The master node is where Codenvy is installed and running. In a [scalability mode]({{base}}/docs/admin-guide/managing/index.html), you can add additional physical "workspace" nodes to increase system capacity.

### Master Node
If you have not added any additional physical workspace nodes, then the Codenvy master node runs core services and workspaces.

![AIO.png]({{base}}/docs/assets/imgs/codenvy/AIO.png)

#### Master Node: External Ports
All ports are TCP unless otherwise noted.

|Port >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>|Service >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|80 / 443|HAProxy HTTP/S|HTTP is the default. If you configure [HTTP/S]({{base}}/docs/admin-guide/configuration/index.html#https), then port 80 can be closed.
|5000|Docker Registry|Embedded registry to save workspace snapshots. This port is not required if you configure an external registry or have not added additional workspace nodes.
|23750|Docker|On a fresh install, Docker is running on port 23750, and Swarm reaches it at `$CODENVY_HOST:23750`. If a master node isn't used to run workspaces, this port can be filtered.
|32768-65535|Docker and Codenvy Agent|Users who launch servers in their workspace bind to ephemeral ports in this range. This range can be limited.

#### Master Node: Internal Ports
All ports are TCP unless otherwise noted.

|Port >>>>>>>>|Service >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>|
|---|---|
|81|Nginx
|2181|ZooKeeper
|2375|Docker
|5432|Postgres
|8080|Codenvy Server

### Workspace Nodes
You can add as many workspace nodes as required to handle additional demand.

![master_plus_node.png]({{base}}/docs/assets/imgs/codenvy/master_plus_node.png)

#### Workspace Node: External Ports
All ports are TCP unless otherwise noted.

|Port >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>|Service >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|80 / 443|HAProxy HTTP/S|HTTP is the default. If you configure [HTTP/S]({{base}}/docs/admin-guide/configuration/index.html#https), then port 80 can be closed.
|32768-65535|Docker and Codenvy Agents|Users who launch servers in their workspace bind to ephemeral ports in this range. This range can be limited.

The Docker daemon will need to be remotely accessed by Codenvy, so it has to be [setup to use a TCP socket](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#/daemon-socket-option). This port only needs to be accessible to the Codenvy master node.

#### Workspace Node: Internal Ports
All ports are TCP unless otherwise noted.

|Port |Service >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>|Notes|
| --- |--- |--- |
|2375|Docker Daemon|Swarm should be able to reach Docker daemon from the master node. If Master node is in a different network, this port should be extrenally accessible.
|4789|Docker Overlay (UDP)|Workspace nodes use this port to create overlay networks. If Workspace nodes are is different networks, this port should be externally accessible.
|7946|Docker Overlay (TCP + UDP)|Workspace nodes use this port to create overlay networks. If Workspace nodes are is different networks, this port should be externally accessible.
